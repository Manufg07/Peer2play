# ðŸŒŠ Liquidity Pool DApp - Peer2Play Assessment

## ðŸš€ Introduction
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that demonstrates the functionality of a liquidity pool on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes the deployment of two ERC20 tokens, a liquidity pool smart contract, and features such as adding/removing liquidity and token swapping. The DApp is built using Solidity, Hardhat, and React.js for a seamless user experience.
